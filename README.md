# lamp-devcontainer

This is a LAMP devcontainer.
All content inside the html folder is visible to the webclient via the document-root of the webserver.

## scss
I also installed scss. Any scss inside the scss folder is configured to compile automatically into normal css inside the css folder.Therefore you should never directly edit the css because it will get overwritten.
